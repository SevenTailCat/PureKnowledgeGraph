# PureKnowledgeGraph
A Sustainably Growing Knowledge Graph from Which LLMs Will Benefit

## 
In the PURE knowledge graph, traditional edges and attributes are defined as new nodes as a way to increase the inference functionality of edges and nodes, in the hope that the knowledge graph will benefit from long-range inference as it grows.
